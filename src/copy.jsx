		title: 'AssetAvenue.com',
		text: <p>AssetAvenueâ€™s newly hired CTO hired me in his drive to completely overhaul a struggling tech team, whose technology was in a state of complete disarray. With this entirely new team, completed a product redesign and rewrite, and to launch a product within three months, a task that the previous team had failed to fulfill in almost two years. We then built out a complete mortgage origination system for three separate products, that allowed the approval and services of loan in as little as 10 days. Our final initiative, that started last summer, was to build an underwriting system to alleviate a lot of complexities in that process. After working primary in marketing, on projects with limited shelf lives it has been a remarkably rewarding and challenging task, working on a product in an Agile environment that is constantly in flux.</p>

		title: "Nogpong!",
		text: <span><p>The designer assigned to this year's holiday promotional project really wanted to do something with robots. Unfortunately, that's about where his creativity ended.  After spinning wheels for weeks, I thought of playing beer pong with an internet controlled robot in the shower one morning. When the producer on the project suggested Eggnog instead of beer, Nogpong! was born.</p><p>We wound up having three separate Nogpong! events.</p></span>

	ringblender: {
		title: "Ringblender.com",
		text: <p>Ringblender was one of the most difficult projects I ever worked on. We built it in Flash, with PHP services.  The user could create a ringtone out of songs from "various" artists, but dragging various samples onto a 10 second timeline.</p>

	sxsw: {
		title: "SSLA's SXSW Portal",
		text: <p>I built this on Wordpress. It was a place for Saatchilians to share their experiences at SXSW and a place to track their locations, as well as to show off faces and projects. It integrated Google maps with Twitter, Facebook, and that checkin app that no one uses any more...</p>

	searchauto: {
		title: "Search Auto Campaigns",
		text: <span><p>I share this project because it was something of a coupe. Saatchi had been building hundreds of units for this campaign. So, anytime a copy change came down, the vendor would have to go in and change the copy in all of those units - for each make and model that Toyota built at the time.</p><p>I told them that that was crazy, and convinced the producers and our marketing partners to build the campaign with 3 units, and lots of xml and images. </p><p>I can't imagine how much money I saved Toyota since that project was completed.</p></span>
